"Nashville Housing Data Processing"

This project showcases my data processing skills using SQL. I worked with a dataset of Nashville housing information, focusing on standardizing and cleaning the data. The tasks performed include converting date formats, populating missing property addresses, splitting address fields into individual columns, converting values in a specific field, removing duplicates, and removing unused columns. By applying these data processing techniques, I ensured the dataset's consistency and improved its quality. This project demonstrates my ability to handle real-world data challenges and highlights my proficiency in SQL for data manipulation and transformation.
